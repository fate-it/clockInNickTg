# Clock Script

The script makes your Telegram nickname more interactive by adding a clock to it.

# Easy start
Just clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/idealey/clockInNickTg
```
To work with the script, you need to get your API_ID and API_HASH telegram. 
And also in the code, initialize the corresponding variables with your data: API_ID, API_HASH, timeZone, nickname. 
Set your time zone and choose a nickname. Ultimately, your nickname will look like this - nickname|00:00
